= printplan - Print items from a .plan file

== DESCRIPTION

Prints unfinished items from a .plan file. Only print anything if current time
is during working hours.

The "working hours" condition is there because I have my shell's RC file call
this program every time it starts up. I don't want to see work stuff at home.

== USE

    $ printplan

The program looks for $HOME/.plan and prints it. It takes no options.

== PLAN FILE

We assume the plan file follows a slightly modified Carmack style:

    . Item      Mentioned, but not fixed or implemented that day
    * Item      Completed on that day
    + Item      Completed on a later day
    - Item      Decided against on a later day

The program will only print entries on lines that start with a '.'.

The reason for the modified Carmack style is that I thought I'd like to write
more details below entries, like so:

    . Item foo bar spam

    Lorem ipsum ...

So far, this hasn't actually happened. If it continues not to, we might just
revert to plain old Carmack style.
