= printplan - Print items from a .plan file

== DESCRIPTION

Prints unfinished items from a .plan file. Only print anything if current time
is during working hours.

The "working hours" condition is there because I have my shell's RC file call
this program every time it starts up. I don't want to see work stuff at home.

== USE

    $ printplan [OPTION]

The program looks for $HOME/.plan and prints it. It accepts these options:

    -h  Print help

== PLAN FILE

We assume the plan file follows a slightly modified Carmack style:

    . Item      Mentioned, but not fixed or implemented that day
    * Item      Completed on that day
    + Item      Completed on a later day
    - Item      Decided against on a later day

The program will only print entries on lines that start with a '.'.

The reason for the modified Carmack style is that I thought I'd like to write
more details below entries, like so:

    . Item foo bar spam

    Lorem ipsum ...

So far, this hasn't actually happened. If it continues not to, we might just
revert to plain old Carmack style.

== RAISON D'ÊTRE

Every six moons or so, someone will post John Carmack's .plan archive to Hacker
News after reading about them in "Masters of Doom".

One of those times, I thought that was a good idea and figured I'd try using a
.plan file at $work. I didn't want to publish mine company-wide, but just have
something that wasn't Jira to remind me what I had wanted to be doing.

I also wanted to only have this thing remind me about things I hadn't done yet,
and be quick enough about it to include it in my shell's RC file.

If we're being honest, grep was fast enough for this, but I also just wanted to
write something in C. Also, I only wanted to print the .plan during working
hours, and did _not_ want to figure out the shell incantation to do that.
