= printplan - Print items from a .plan file

== DESCRIPTION

Prints unfinished items from a .plan file. Only print anything if current time
is during working hours.

The "working hours" condition is there because I have my shell's RC file call
this program every time it starts up. I don't want to see work stuff at home.

== USE

    $ printplan [OPTION]

The program looks for $HOME/.plan and prints it. It accepts these options:

    -f  Force printing outside of working hours
    -h  Print help

== PLAN FILE

We assume the items in the user's .plan file follow Carmack syntax:

    Item        Mentioned, but not fixed or implemented that day
    * Item      Completed on that day
    + Item      Completed on a later day
    - Item      Decided against on a later day

The program will only print entries that have not been completed or decided
against.

From the syntax it follows that we can use other ad-hoc delimiters to signify
lines that should not be printed, but mean something to the .plan author. For
example, I use '=' to mark dates or .plan headings.

== RAISON D'ÊTRE

Every six moons or so, someone will post John Carmack's .plan archive to Hacker
News after reading about them in "Masters of Doom".

One of those times, I thought that was a good idea and figured I'd try using a
.plan file at $work. I didn't want to publish mine company-wide, but just have
something that wasn't Jira to remind me what I had wanted to be doing.

I also wanted to only have this thing remind me about things I hadn't done yet,
and be quick enough about it to include it in my shell's RC file.

If we're being honest, grep was fast enough for this, but I also just wanted to
write something in C. Also, I only wanted to print the .plan during working
hours, and did _not_ want to figure out the shell incantation to do that.

== EXAMPLE

I have this in my .zshrc file:

    printplan

Whenever I spawn a new shell, it prints the unfinished items from my .plan file
if it's still working hours. My .plan file looks like this:

    = Writing Java while not wearing a tie is a syntax error.
