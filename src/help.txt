printplan - Print unfinished .plan items

This program prints unfinished items from the user's .plan file.

USE:

    printplan [OPTION...]

OPTIONS:

    -h  Print this help message
    -v  Print the version number

PLAN SYNTAX:

We assume the items in the user's .plan file follow modified Carmack syntax:

    . Item      Mentioned, but not fixed or implemented that day
    * Item      Completed on that day
    + Item      Completed on a later day
    - Item      Decided against on a later day

The program will only print entries on lines that start with a '.'.
